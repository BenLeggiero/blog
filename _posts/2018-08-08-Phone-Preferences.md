People often ask me why I am using a Samsung Galaxy S7, a phone from 3 years ago, despite me being such a tech enthusiast and macOS Software Engineer.

It's simple, really; it just comes down to my requirements in a phone. There certainly are contenders, and I've made a table below showing my reasonings, but the S7 still seems to be the best fit for me.
