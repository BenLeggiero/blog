Pronouns! For when you want to talk about someone without using their name over and over. Being trans, I've thought about and experienced a lot of very interesting things about pronouns over the years.

Let's start off simple: My preferred pronouns! I have none. Call me him, her, them, [em](#my-pronouns), it, whatever you want as long as you respect me. ... Okay, so maybe I didn't start off _that_ simple. Still, I think it's good to get that out of the way so you understand my experience.

I'd also like to mention that [I talked about this](/Pronouns-(2015)) in my previous blog in 2015, which I'm migrating to this blog along with this post. Feel free to go see how I thought about this over 5 years ago üòÅ



# What pronouns are valid? #

In general, if someone says they prefer a certain set of pronouns, that's perfectly valid. Quite a few have come along over the past many years, and quite a few of those have fallen out of favor. I'm gonna take this opportunity to do my favorite thing and make a table!

# Singularity vs. Plurality #

The Contentious One‚Ñ¢! Is "they/them" singular or plural? Well, I have a strong opinion on this, which comes from my experience living amongst a certain group of people:

Kind of happening alongside the movements to improve acceptance of gender and sexuality, is a similar movement for plurality, meaning **multiple people sharing one body**. These groups often refer to themselves as **systems**. Many folks in my life are or have been plural: Three of my ex-partners, two of my closest friends, and one of my metamours all shared their body with at least one other person. For some of these folks, I only knew one cohabitant; for example, one of my closest friends for the past decade shares a body with someone else, but I don't know the other at all. This can happen for many reasons, and I highly encourage you to [read about plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_(psychology)), since it's a fascinating still-developing topic in society.

Clearly, it's expected and acceptable for members and outsiders to refer to these plural systems using plural language. "They tend to like chillhop," or "one of them is a girl," or "we decided to start a YouTube channel."

Because of this, I take the strong position that "they/them" can be used for both singular and plural subjects, but must be conjugated properly:

> <span data-pronoun="singular-3rd-subjective">They</span> is walking with me <span data-pronoun="singular-3rd-subjective">they</span> stops to pick up a cool rock. <span data-pronoun="singular-3rd-subjective">They</span> hands it to me and smiles, and I smile back at <span data-pronoun="singular-3rd-objective">them</span>. <span data-pronoun="singular-3rd-possessive-determiner">Their</span> grin is far more valuable than the rock. <span data-pronoun="singular-3rd-subjective">They</span>'s proud of <span data-pronoun="singular-3rd-reflexive">themself</span> for making me smile too.

TODO: Have controls here to swap out 3rd-person pronouns
