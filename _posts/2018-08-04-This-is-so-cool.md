# This is so cool! #

Last night I made a blog at https://BenLeggiero.blog and mirrored it on https://micro.blog/BenLeggiero! 

Thanks to [Manton Reece](https://Manton.org), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (and [Trello](https://trello.com)'s [Barry Clark](http://www.barryclark.co) for [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)), [Hover](https://Hover.com), [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com), and [GitHub](https://GitHub.com) for making this so easy!
