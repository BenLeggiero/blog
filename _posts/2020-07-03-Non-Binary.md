That's the umbrella over my gender! Ironic, isn't it? "But you're a programmer, you love binary!" üòù


I don't particularly care about my own gender, actually. For a long time, I've let folks use whatever pronouns they want for me. As long as they show common respect and decency, it doesn't really matter to me. Of course, I take the time and care to shown them the common respect and decency of knowing and honoring their genders and pronouns &ndash; that should go without saying.

The genders read "Gender-Neutral", "Gender-Queer", "Androgynous", "Demigirl", "Demiboy", "Demi-fluid", "Gender-fluid", "Agender", "Bigender", and "Polygender".](/images/The Non-Binary Umbrella.svg){:.mid-post-hero}


That said, I do enjoy making myself look good. I like sculpting the person in the mirror &ndash; my beard and hair are especially fun to play with. Next up, I'm looking to sculpt the rest of my body. I've been working out more, tracking all my nutrients, and taking hormones, to build my muscle, trim some fat, and grow breasts. I'm looking forward to how I'll look afterwards!


I'd like to see the world embrace gender as a way to express oneself, and communicate one's desired lifestyle. Someday soon I hope to see it become untied from sex completely. The same with sexuality: I think folks should love whom they love. One's gender can come into play, but it shouldn't be assumed that it does.


Probably one of the worst things I've seen happen in the world of gender and sexuality is gatekeeping. "You can't date him; you're gay!" or "You can't wear a dress; you're non-binary!" &ndash; These ring, to me, like some sort of deeply-implanted divide-and-conquer by hateful people who wish to eradicate freedom from relationships. It feels, to me, like an attempt to pit us against each other, so we destroy each other instead of them destroying us. It's not worth quibbling about whether a gender or sexuality is valid, or if an expression or romance matches a person's stated identity. All this energy needs to be directed to accepting and supporting any and all gender and sexuality expressions and identities.
